    "title": "Are Video Generation Models Geographically Fair? An Attraction-Centric Evaluation of Global Visual Knowledge",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced visually compelling results, yet it remains unclear whether these models encode geographically equitable visual knowledge. In this work, we investigate the geo-equity and geographically grounded visual knowledge of text-to-video models through an attraction-centric evaluation. We introduce Geo-Attraction Landmark Probing (GAP), a systematic framework for assessing how faithfully models synthesize tourist attractions from diverse regions, and construct GEOATTRACTION-500, a benchmark of 500 globally distributed attractions spanning varied regions and popularity levels. GAP integrates complementary metrics that disentangle overall video quality from attraction-specific knowledge, including global structural alignment, fine-grained keypoint-based alignment, and vision-language model judgments, all validated against human evaluation. Applying GAP to the state-of-the-art text-to-video model Sora 2, we find that, contrary to common assumptions of strong geographic bias, the model exhibits a relatively uniform level of geographically grounded visual knowledge across regions, development levels, and cultural groupings, with only weak dependence on attraction popularity. These results suggest that current text-to-video models express global visual knowledge more evenly than expected, highlighting both their promise for globally deployed applications and the need for continued evaluation as such systems evolve.",

    "title": "GenAgent: Scaling Text-to-Image Generation via Agentic Multimodal Reasoning",
    "abstract": "We introduce GenAgent, unifying visual understanding and generation through an agentic multimodal model. Unlike unified models that face expensive training costs and understanding-generation trade-offs, GenAgent decouples these capabilities through an agentic framework: understanding is handled by the multimodal model itself, while generation is achieved by treating image generation models as invokable tools. Crucially, unlike existing modular systems constrained by static pipelines, this design enables autonomous multi-turn interactions where the agent generates multimodal chains-of-thought encompassing reasoning, tool invocation, judgment, and reflection to iteratively refine outputs. We employ a two-stage training strategy: first, cold-start with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality tool invocation and reflection data to bootstrap agent behaviors; second, end-to-end agentic reinforcement learning combining pointwise rewards (final image quality) and pairwise rewards (reflection accuracy), with trajectory resampling for enhanced multi-turn exploration. GenAgent significantly boosts base generator(FLUX.1-dev) performance on GenEval++ (+23.6\\%) and WISE (+14\\%). Beyond performance gains, our framework demonstrates three key properties: 1) cross-tool generalization to generators with varying capabilities, 2) test-time scaling with consistent improvements across interaction rounds, and 3) task-adaptive reasoning that automatically adjusts to different tasks. Our code will be available at \\href{https://github.com/deep-kaixun/GenAgent}{this url}.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on existing low-level vision benchmarks, which primarily focus on generic images. However, their capabilities to perceive and assess portrait images, a domain characterized by distinct structural and perceptual properties, remain largely underexplored. To this end, we introduce Q-Bench-Portrait, the first holistic benchmark specifically designed for portrait image quality perception, comprising 2,765 image-question-answer triplets and featuring (1) diverse portrait image sources, including natural, synthetic distortion, AI-generated, artistic, and computer graphics images; (2) comprehensive quality dimensions, covering technical distortions, AIGC-specific distortions, and aesthetics; and (3) a range of question formats, including single-choice, multiple-choice, true/false, and open-ended questions, at both global and local levels. Based on Q-Bench-Portrait, we evaluate 20 open-source and 5 closed-source MLLMs, revealing that although current models demonstrate some competence in portrait image perception, their performance remains limited and imprecise, with a clear gap relative to human judgments. We hope that the proposed benchmark will foster further research into enhancing the portrait image perception capabilities of both general-purpose and domain-specific MLLMs.",

    "title": "Integrating Fine-Grained Audio-Visual Evidence for Robust Multimodal Emotion Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Multimodal emotion analysis is shifting from static classification to generative reasoning. Beyond simple label prediction, robust affective reasoning must synthesize fine-grained signals such as facial micro-expressions and prosodic which shifts to decode the latent causality within complex social contexts. However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face significant limitations in fine-grained perception, primarily due to data scarcity and insufficient cross-modal fusion. As a result, these models often exhibit unimodal dominance which leads to hallucinations in complex multimodal interactions, particularly when visual and acoustic cues are subtle, ambiguous, or even contradictory (e.g., in sarcastic scenery). To address this, we introduce SABER-LLM, a framework designed for robust multimodal reasoning. First, we construct SABER, a large-scale emotion reasoning dataset comprising 600K video clips, annotated with a novel six-dimensional schema that jointly captures audiovisual cues and causal logic. Second, we propose the structured evidence decomposition paradigm, which enforces a \"perceive-then-reason\" separation between evidence extraction and reasoning to alleviate unimodal dominance. The ability to perceive complex scenes is further reinforced by consistency-aware direct preference optimization, which explicitly encourages alignment among modalities under ambiguous or conflicting perceptual conditions. Experiments on EMER, EmoBench-M, and SABER-Test demonstrate that SABER-LLM significantly outperforms open-source baselines and achieves robustness competitive with closed-source models in decoding complex emotional dynamics. The dataset and model are available at https://github.com/zxzhao0/SABER-LLM.",

Our results indicate that theoretically scaffolded personas approximate the moral judgements observed in human samples, suggesting that LLM-based personas can serve as credible and complementary tools for organizational research in contexts where direct access to executives is limited. We conclude by outlining implications for future research using LLM-based personas in organizational settings.",

    "abstract": "Demographic probing is widely used to study how large language models (LLMs) adapt their behavior to signaled demographic attributes. This approach typically uses a single demographic cue in isolation (e.g., a name or dialect) as a signal for group membership, implicitly assuming strong construct validity: that such cues are interchangeable operationalizations of the same underlying, demographically conditioned behavior. We test this assumption in realistic advice-seeking interactions, focusing on race and gender in a U.S. context. We find that cues intended to represent the same demographic group induce only partially overlapping changes in model behavior, while differentiation between groups within a given cue is weak and uneven. Consequently, estimated disparities are unstable, with both magnitude and direction varying across cues. We further show that these inconsistencies partly arise from variation in how strongly cues encode demographic attributes and from linguistic confounders that independently shape model behavior. Together, our findings suggest that demographic probing lacks construct validity: it does not yield a single, stable characterization of how LLMs condition on demographic information, which may reflect a misspecified or fragmented construct. We conclude by recommending the use of multiple, ecologically valid cues and explicit control of confounders to support more defensible claims about demographic effects in LLMs.",

    "abstract": "When humans face problems beyond their immediate capabilities, they rely on tools, providing a promising paradigm for improving visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \\textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw.",

Prior work has employed so-called personas, sociodemographic user attributes conveyed to a model, to study bias in LLMs by relying on a single cue to prompt a persona, such as user names or explicit attribute mentions. This disregards LLM sensitivity to prompt variations (robustness) and the rarity of some cues in real interactions (external validity). We compare six commonly used persona cues across seven open and proprietary LLMs on four writing and advice tasks. While cues are overall highly correlated, they produce substantial variance in responses across personas. We therefore caution against claims from a single persona cue and recommend future personalization research to evaluate multiple externally valid cues.",

We present a conditional diffusion framework that learns a probabilistic mapping from noisy body surface signals to heart surface electric potentials. The proposed approach leverages the generative nature of diffusion models to capture the non-unique and underdetermined nature of the ECGI inverse problem, enabling probabilistic sampling of multiple reconstructions rather than a single deterministic estimate. Unlike traditional methods, the proposed framework is geometry-free and purely data-driven, alleviating the need for patient-specific mesh construction. We evaluate the method on a real ECGI dataset and compare it against strong deterministic baselines, including a convolutional neural network, long short-term memory network, and transformer-based model. The results demonstrate that the proposed diffusion approach achieves improved reconstruction accuracy, highlighting the potential of diffusion models as a robust tool for noninvasive cardiac electrophysiology imaging.",

To explore this space, current workflows rely on manual slider-based tuning, an approach that scales poorly and makes weight selection difficult, even when the candidate set is limited to 20-30 adapters. We propose GimmBO to support interactive exploration of adapter merging for image generation through Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO).

Based on blind pairwise comparisons by 28 expert judges and 131 lay judges, we find that experts preferred human writing in 82.7% of cases under the in-context prompting condition but this reversed to 62% preference for AI after fine-tuning on authors' complete works. Lay judges, however, consistently preferred AI writing. Debrief interviews with expert writers revealed that their preference for AI writing triggered an identity crisis, eroding aesthetic confidence and questioning what constitutes \"good writing.\" These findings challenge discourse about AI's creative limitations and raise fundamental questions about the future of creative labor.",

    "abstract": "In some areas of computing, natural language processing and information science, progress is made by sharing datasets and challenging the community to design the best algorithm for an associated task. This article introduces a shared dataset of 1446 short texts, each of which describes a research quality score on the UK scale of 1* to 4*. This is a messy collection, with some texts not containing scores and others including invalid scores or strange formats. With this dataset there is also a description of what constitutes a valid score and a \"gold standard\" of the correct scores for these texts (including missing values). The challenge is to design a prompt for Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the scores from these texts as accurately as possible. The format for the response should be a number and no other text so there are two aspects to the challenge: ensuring that the LLM returns only a number, and instructing it to deduce the correct number for the text. As part of this, the LLM prompt needs to explain when to return the missing value code, -1, instead of a number when the text does not clearly contain one. The article also provides an example of a simple prompt. The purpose of the challenge is twofold: to get an effective solution to this problem, and to increase understanding of prompt design and LLM capabilities for complex numerical tasks. The initial solution suggested has an accuracy of 72.6%, so the challenge is to beat this.",

In an empirical study with 24 end users, UI Remix significantly improved participants' ability to achieve their design goals, facilitated effective iteration, and encouraged exploration of alternative designs.
